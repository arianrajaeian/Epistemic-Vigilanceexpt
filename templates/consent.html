<p>This research is being conducted by Dr Thomas Morgan, a researcher in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University. We are conducting a research study to understand when and how people use different kinds of social information. </p>

<p> During the study, you will be assigned to be either player 1 or player 2. You will be shown a series of pictures and asked to judge whether there are more or fewer blue circles than yellow circles. Player 1 will be asked to leave advice for player 2 about what they should answer. Player 2 will get to see player 1’s advice or their answer. The study will take around 15 minutes and you will be paid $2 upon completing the study and an additional bonus of up to $2 depending on your score. </p>

<p>Your participation in this study is voluntary and you may stop your participation at any time. If you choose to withdraw from the study, there will be no penalty, however you will not be paid unless you complete the study.</p>

<p>There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your participation. If you are player 1, your responses in this study will be shown to one other participant while the study is ongoing, but they will be anonymous. Your responses will be confidential once the study completes, and not associated with your name in any way. However, while the study is running, they will be associated with your Prolific id. Once the study is complete, we will replace your worker id with a random string. The results of this study may be used in reports, presentations, or publications but your name and Prolific id will not be used. </p>

<p>If you have any questions concerning the research study, please contact the lead researcher, Thomas Morgan, at: thomas.j.h.morgan@asu.edu. If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this research, or if you feel you have been placed at risk, you can contact the Chair of the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board, through the ASU Office of Research Integrity and Assurance, at (480) 965-6788.</p>
