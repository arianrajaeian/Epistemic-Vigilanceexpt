	    <p>Thank you for taking part in the study. Once you submit your responses below, you will automatically receive the base payment. You will receive your bonus payment once both player 1 and player 2 have completed the study. </p>

	    <p><strong>Please ensure that you click “Continue” below once you are finished. Otherwise, your response may not be recorded, and you may not be paid correctly. </strong></p>

	    <p>The aim of this study was to investigate when people are influenced by different kinds of social information. Specifically, we predicted that social information would be less influential in cases where it was less likely to be trustworthy. In addition, we were also investigating whether people selectively choose to share honest social information when it would be personally beneficial. (POSSIBLY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONFIDENCE ELEMENT?)</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about the study, or would like a summary of the results once the study is complete, feel free to send an email to the lead researcher: (PUT SOMEONE ELSE'S EMAIL HERE)</p>
